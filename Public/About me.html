    <li>A lil bit about myself, I am an only child but i wasnt coddled or given all i wanted My parents were truly asian, codeled when i was good and gave a stern talking in my case " heavy belt whopping " LOL, Grew up to be a sales person but I decided that i donthave to work for anyone to bow down and say sorry about things whihc are not in my control instead work on something that gives me some sort of achievement and satisfacion.</li>
    <li>After numerous experiments and head breaking brain storms finally I stumbled onto Webdevelopment whihc i think would make a great new path for me, I belive i may do wonders if i pursue this path. at the end of the day i wanna be my own boss and be satisfied with what i do. kudos and cheers to new beginning, Also Im an hardcore Star wars fan do not be alarmed if you find my portfolio full of star wars references. :P</li>
